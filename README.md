# 📦 BagSeek: Semantic Exploration of ROS Data

**BagSeek** is an interactive tool for semantically exploring large-scale ROS 2 bag files. It allows users to search and filter image data using natural language queries powered by CLIP-based embeddings and FAISS indexing and export meaningful subsets of the data.

## 🧭 Key Features

- Panel-based layout for synchronized visualization of image, pointcloud, positional, imu and metadata streams
- Semantic image search via natural language prompts (CLIP + FAISS)
- Model selection from multiple OpenCLIP variants (e.g. `ViT-B-16` trained by [*OpenAI*](https://openai.com/index/clip/), `ViT-H-14` trained with the [*LAION2B*](https://laion.ai/blog/laion-5b/) Dataset)
- Export of filtered Rosbag segments based on timespans, topic, or data type
- Color-coded layout configuration management
- Offline-ready, privacy-preserving system

## 📸 Example Use Case

A user analyzing agricultural robotics data can:

1. Select a ROS 2 bag file from local storage.
2. Configure a custom panel-layout for exploring multimodal topic data.
3. Enter a query like "cow on the field" or "tree stump", retrieve matching frames and view their distribution across time.
4. Export relevant data slices (e.g. images containing objects of interest).

## 🚀 Installation

### Prerequisites

-	Anaconda / Miniconda
- Python 3.10+
- Node.js (v18+ recommended)
- ROS 2 (tested with Humble)
- (Optional) GPU with CUDA for faster inference

### Backend Setup (Flask + FAISS)

```bash
# Clone the repo
git clone https://github.com/nepok/BagSeek.git
cd bagseek/flask-backend/api

# Create and activate Conda environment
conda create -n bagseek-gpu python=3.10
conda activate bagseek-gpu

# First use conda to install the "heavy" dependencies if available
conda install numpy pandas flask faiss-gpu -c conda-forge

# Then use pip for the rest
pip install open_clip_torch torchvision matplotlib

# Start the backend server
flask run --debug
```

### Frontend Setup (React + TypeScript)

```bash
cd bagseek/react-frontend
npm install
npm start
```

## 🧪 Evaluation Summary

BagSeek was developed as part of a Bachelor's thesis on semantic image retrieval in agricultural robotics. Six pre-trained CLIP models were evaluated on real-world agricultural scenarios. The results are compared in the following summary plots to assess differences in retrieval performance.
